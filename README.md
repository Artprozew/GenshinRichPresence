## Overview

**Show your friends on Discord what you're up to in Genshin Impact!**

This is a **Discord Rich Presence** program for **Genshin Impact** that works by analyzing **GIMI**'s log file in real-time to determine the current game status, **updating your Discord game activity accordingly**.

### Why do it this way?

You're right, accessing game information through GIMI's log file might not be the **most** elegant solution. Ideally, the game would directly share your activity with Discord.
But this method is currently **one of the few ways** to get in-game information like this **without changing the game files** itself. Additionally, this method **doesn't use OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) at all, which makes it potentially even **more performant**.

### Is it safe?

Yes, this program is considered safe. It just reads a log file generated by GIMI, and **does not modify any game files**, so there's no risk of harming your game or your computer.

### Features
- **Automatically** displays your **current character**, **region** or other info
- **Doesn't modify** your **game files** and **does not use OCR**
- **Fully customizable** Rich Presence through the `config.ini` file, **custom gifs** are also allowed
- Can **start GIMI and Genshin Impact automatically** when you **launch** the program's executable
- Program **stays hidden on your system tray**, and when you **close** your game, the program will **also close itself**
- Can now be **installed easily** through the installer!

## Running the Executable

The pre-built executable is a convenient option for **users** who want to **avoid installing Python**.
However, anti-virus **might** flag the .exe incorrectly as a "virus", you can check the [anti-virus disclaimer](#anti-virus-disclaimer).

### Prerequisites

- **Download** the **setup/installer** from [Releases][releases].
- Have [GIMI][GIMI] set-up.

### Instructions

- Run the **installer**, it **will guide you.**
- Run the `GenshinRichPresence.exe`
- Your activity **must now be visible** on your **Discord profile**, **have fun!**

Read [Considerations](#considerations) for more info.

## Running from Source Code

This method is suitable for users **familiar with Python** or **encountering issues with the executable**.

### Prerequisites

- Have [GIMI][GIMI] set-up.
- [Python 3.9+][Python] (Python already comes with [pip][pip] installed, but [Poetry][Poetry] is recommended).

### Installation

> [!TIP]
> (**Optional**) **For Poetry**: If you want to install the **developer dependencies**, you can append `--group=dev` to the `poetry install` command.

1. [Download][GH Download] and extract the repository (or just [clone][GH Clone] it).
2. Open the project folder, right click on a blank space and click "open Command Prompt/Terminal".
3. **Install dependencies** using the command for either pip (`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`) or Poetry (`poetry install`).

### Instructions

See above [Instructions](#instructions), for step 2 you can instead:
- Open a command prompt on the project root directory and run the command `pythonw src/main.py`. You could also save a `.bat` file with that command if you want.
- Alternatively, you can run the `main.py` file inside the `src` folder by double-clicking, but it will also bring up the unwanted **command prompt**, rename the `main.py` to `main.pyw` if you don't want that to happen.

## Considerations

If you **install and launch** the program **while your game is still running**, **press F10 to reload it**.
</br>
**Make sure the game is running with 3DMigoto.**

For now, the program also creates a "RichPresenceData" folder inside your GIMI's Mods folder when you launch it. This is required for it to work.

You can **always install** the program on the **same folder**, if you would want to **update** it, for example. The settings at your `config.ini` are going to be **preserved** and **applied when you run the program**.

If you play on the **Chinese servers**, your game executable must be named `YuanShen.exe`, in this case, run the **installer** in the **Chinese language**.

If you want to **customize** or **change** something, **read and edit** the `config.ini` file, and then **restart the program**.

This program is not **fully tested yet** and may have some problems. Any **feedback** is appreciated.

When the program starts, it will **stay hidden** on your **system tray**, and will wait your game to open **within 60 seconds**, if it doesn't find it or if you close your game, the **program will also close itself**.

If any **error** occurs, the program may exit by itself, and will write the error on the `traceback.txt` file.

## Known issues

Although still under development, this method is not perfect and may have limitations. But keep in mind that it does work as expected **most of the time**.
Some of the issues described here may be fixed or worked around in the future. The problems observed are:

- When you start the game, it might not detect your current character/region **until you switch your character** or **walk/teleport** to another place.
- Occasionally, especially during **teleports**, the program might display an incorrect character. This issue can also be fixed when you switch characters. ([#17][#17])
- When there's **more than one playable character** on screen, the program can also struggle to detect your character correctly (e.g.: Multiplayer or cutscenes).
- Due to the program relying on analyzing **hashes**, some information might be incorrect at times. These hashes may be wrong or outdated. ([#27][#27])

## Disclaimer

GenshinRichPresence is an **unofficial third-party** application and is not affiliated with HoYoverse in any way. It is developed and maintained independently.

### Anti-Virus Disclaimer

Some anti-virus software (Windows Defender or similar) might flag the executable as a potential threat due to overly cautious heuristics. This is a known issue called **"false positive"**, especially considering the program is built from **Python** code.

Python is a widely used and well-established programming language known for its security. However, anti-virus software might sometimes **misinterpret** the behavior of programs created with Python. See: [Windows Defender false positives][Windows Defender]

If you're confident the program is safe, you can [add an exclusion][WinDefender Exclusion] for the program's executable file in your anti-virus software settings. This will **prevent** it from being flagged in the future.

We assure you that the program is **entirely safe** and does not contain any malicious code. If you encounter any issues running the program from the downloaded executable file, you can try [running from source code](#running-from-source-code)

There's still a lot to do, if you want to contribute, fork the repo, submit pull requests, or share any bug fixes or feature ideas you have, **you're much welcome!**
